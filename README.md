# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic Tac Toe project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is great for frontend development. HTML structures the board, CSS styles it, but JavaScript is key. It handles user interactions, updates the board, checks win conditions, and manages turns. This project strengthens skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic building.
